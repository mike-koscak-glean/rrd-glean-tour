      "Give me a recommendation for the 3 business use cases we should prioritize next for OneTru AI Assist. Base it on current pilot learnings, business impact, governance complexity, and fit with TransUnion's 2026 priorities. For each, summarize who benefits, why it matters now, the expected outcome, and what makes it a good early win.",

    aiResponse: `Here are the **3 highest-priority next use cases** for OneTru AI Assist.

**1. Governed analytics copilot for fraud and credit teams**
- **Why this should come first:** it aligns directly with TransUnion's public push toward auditable, explainable, governed analytics and builds on the same momentum as the new Analytics Orchestrator Agent.⁴
- **Who benefits:** fraud analysts, risk analysts, product managers, and analytics leaders.
- **Expected outcome:** faster investigation cycles, less dependency on specialist data science support, and better reuse of internal analytic know-how.¹
- **Why it's an early win:** high strategic value, clear executive story, and strong fit with TransUnion's public narrative around governed AI and credit intelligence.²

**2. Revenue and enablement assistant for sellers and solutions consultants**
- **Why this should come second:** internal discovery already showed strong interest from enablement teams that need better synthesis across product docs, training, proposals, and call recordings.¹
- **Who benefits:** solutions consultants, sellers, proposal teams, and new hires.
- **Expected outcome:** faster ramp, stronger consistency, better meeting prep, and fewer "where do I find that?" bottlenecks.
- **Why it's an early win:** the pain is concrete, the content already exists, and the demo value is immediately obvious.¹³

**3. Security and policy copilot for AI governance and sensitive-data expansion**
- **Why this should come third:** sensitive data access is a gating issue for Salesforce, finance, and other higher-value domains — so governance acceleration unlocks the rest of the roadmap.³
- **Who benefits:** security, compliance, architecture, and AI governance stakeholders.
- **Expected outcome:** faster reviews, clearer approval paths, and more confidence expanding AI into sensitive workflows.
- **Why it's an early win:** it supports the entire program, not just one department.³

| Use Case | Primary Beneficiaries | Strategic Fit | Governance Complexity |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Governed analytics copilot | Fraud / credit / risk teams | ★★★★★ | Medium | 
| Revenue & enablement assistant | SCs / sellers / new hires | ★★★★☆ | Low |
| Security / policy copilot | Security, compliance, architecture | ★★★★☆ | High — but unlocks everything else |

**Bottom line:** this framing lets the program tell a stronger story than "here is how we onboard tools." It says: here is where OneTru AI Assist creates measurable leverage next.²³`,

      "A lender partner is seeing rising first-payment default and possible synthetic identity risk in near-prime auto originations. Pull together the relevant model notes, attribute definitions, partner escalations, and governance guidance, then recommend the most likely drivers, the first 3 analyses we should run, and the first interventions we should test.",

    aiResponse: `Here's a **focused working brief** for the near-prime auto risk spike.

**1. Most likely drivers**
- Drift in a small set of identity consistency and thin-file behavioral attributes — the pattern in Q1 feature performance data shows degradation concentrated in 3–4 synthetic-risk signals.¹²
- A higher share of applications entering from partner/channel combinations with historically noisier applicant profiles, as flagged in partner escalations.³
- Recent policy tuning likely improved conversion but may have widened the range of applicants entering manual review or approval bands.¹

**2. First 3 analyses to run**

1. **Attribute drift analysis** on the top synthetic-risk features for the last 30–60 days — compare PSI and feature stability against the Q1 baseline in the attribute catalog.¹²
2. **Channel / partner decomposition** to isolate whether the spike is concentrated in a narrow acquisition cohort rather than a broad portfolio shift.³
3. **Adverse-action / explainability review** to confirm any intervention can be defended clearly to internal governance and customer teams.³⁴

**3. First interventions to test**
- Tighten review thresholds for the highest-risk synthetic indicators in the affected segment, using the escalation cohort as the starting population.²
- Add a targeted step-up identity check only for the riskiest cohort, rather than applying broad friction that degrades approval rates.³
- Package the workflow into a reusable analyst playbook so future teams can run the same investigation faster.⁴

**4. Governance guardrails**
The Risk Committee explainability standards require any model or threshold change to be documented with a clear rationale before production deployment.³ Running this as a monitored A/B test with defined rollback criteria is the recommended path.

I can also help draft the analyst playbook or pull the relevant governance checklist for threshold changes.`,

      "Prepare a concise briefing on what must be true before we expand OneTru AI Assist into more sensitive domains like Salesforce, finance, and broader HR data. Summarize required controls, current gaps, decision gates for approval, and 3 actions for the next AI Governance Steering Committee.",

    aiResponse: `Here's the **readiness brief** for expanding OneTru AI Assist into more sensitive domains.

**Required controls**
- Confirmed classification coverage on all target repositories¹²
- Permission-aware access mirrored from source systems — no user sees content they can't already access¹
- Audited prompt / answer logging with agreed retention and access policy²
- Clear approval path for any workflow touching regulated or high-sensitivity data³
- Explainability standards for any analytics-derived outputs used in decisions⁴

**Current gaps**
- Uneven classification coverage on some legacy repositories slated for future ingestion¹²
- Incomplete agreement on what "approved" AI use looks like by business function — shadow tooling is filling the vacuum¹
- Unresolved logging / SIEM integration questions that block broader expansion sign-off³

**Recommended decision gates**

| Gate | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | No expansion until targeted repositories meet classification-readiness threshold |
| 2 | No sensitive-domain rollout without agreed monitoring / logging pattern |
| 3 | No business launch without named owner for governance, incident response, and exception handling |

**3 actions for the next Steering Committee**
1. **Approve a formal expansion rubric** for sensitive systems — define what "ready" means with specific, measurable criteria.²³
2. **Finalize AI acceptable-use standards** by function, with explicit guidance distinguishing internal from external tools and approved patterns for customer-facing use.¹
3. **Standardize logging and anomaly-detection expectations** for approved AI vendors and internal agents — then require all approved vendors (including Glean) to meet the standard before sensitive-domain access is granted.³⁴

Clearing these three gates would also accelerate the governed analytics and enablement use cases already identified as highest priority.`,

Include the best value story, 3 proof points to use, likely objections, and the best follow-up asset to send.",

    aiResponse: `Here's the **call brief** for your regional bank meeting.

**Best value story**
TransUnion wins when it helps customers make better risk decisions with more confidence and less friction. Position the conversation around:
- faster, more explainable decisions¹
- stronger fraud and identity confidence backed by trusted data assets²
- practical operational lift for analysts and client teams³

Frame OneTru as the way TransUnion scales reusable intelligence across teams and use cases — not just a product, but a platform advantage.¹²

**3 proof points to use**

1. **Data + analytics + governed AI, combined** — TransUnion's strength comes from the combination of trusted data assets, deep analytics expertise, and governed AI — not any single component alone.¹
2. **Transparency and explainability, not just speed** — regulated customers care that outputs can be defended. Lead with explainability as a feature, not a disclaimer.³
3. **OneTru scales reusable intelligence** — frame it as the way TU consistently delivers across fraud, credit, marketing, and consumer solutions — not a one-off project.¹²

**Likely objections**

| Objection | Suggested response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "How is this different from a generic AI tool?" | TU's advantage is the combination of proprietary data, domain analytics expertise, and governed delivery — no generic tool has that. |
| "How do we keep outputs explainable for regulated decisions?" | Explainability is built into the delivery model — not bolted on afterward. |
| "How do we avoid adding more tool sprawl for field teams?" | OneTru consolidates, it doesn't add. The goal is fewer tools, not more. |

**Best follow-up asset to send**
Send the most concise, approved fraud and identity value one-pager plus one proof-heavy case example that reinforces governed analytics and business outcomes. Avoid decks with more than 5 slides for a first follow-up.⁴

Would you like me to pull the specific one-pager and case example from the proposal library?`,
